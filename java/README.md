# CSCI 366 - StringWeb

## Overview

This is the Cloud project for CSCI 366 - Systems.  It is designed to give you an introduction to cloud development and working with the web.

The goal of this project is to build a simple web server that transforms strings.  Since this is not a web programming
class, and since you already have an extensive C-based project, we will be running this project a little differently:
I will be implementing most of the functionality on live streams, and explaining what I am doing as we go along.  You
may copy down my implementation, **however**, you are expected to comment the code clearly and explain what is going on.

Your grade will be split 90/10 between the test suite, which is very simple, and the quality of your comments in the
code base.

## Deploying To The Cloud

For extra credit, you can try to deploying your applications to the cloud via [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), a
